# Understanding Finetuning

## What is Model Finetuning?

Model finetuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to perform better on a specific task or dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, you start with a model that has already learned general patterns and then refine it for your particular use case.

## Why Finetune?

### Advantages of Finetuning

- **Faster Training**: Pre-trained models already have learned useful features
- **Less Data Required**: You don't need massive datasets like the original training
- **Better Performance**: Often achieves better results than training from scratch
- **Resource Efficient**: Requires less computational power and time

### When to Use Finetuning

- You have a specific domain or task
- Limited training data available
- Need to adapt a general model to your use case
- Want to improve model performance on specific tasks

## Types of Finetuning

### 1. Full Finetuning
- Updates all model parameters
- Most flexible but requires more resources
- Best for significant domain shifts

### 2. Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT)
- Updates only a small subset of parameters
- Examples: LoRA, AdaLoRA, QLoRA
- Faster and more memory-efficient

### 3. Instruction Tuning
- Focuses on following instructions
- Useful for chat models and assistants
- Trains on instruction-response pairs

## The Finetuning Process

1. **Select Base Model**: Choose a pre-trained model suitable for your task
2. **Prepare Dataset**: Create training data in the right format
3. **Configure Training**: Set up hyperparameters and training settings
4. **Train Model**: Run the finetuning process
5. **Evaluate**: Test performance on validation data
6. **Deploy**: Use your finetuned model in production

## Common Challenges

- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data instead of generalizing
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Model forgets previously learned knowledge
- **Data Quality**: Poor quality training data leads to poor results
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Finding the right learning rate and other settings

## Next Steps

In the next section, we'll set up your development environment for finetuning. Make sure you have Java and the necessary ML libraries installed.
