# Training Your First Model

This learning path guides you through the complete process of training your first machine learning model using Java.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up your ML development environment
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model architecture selection
- Training pipeline implementation
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deployment and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Basic Java programming knowledge
- Understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms

## Learning Path Overview

This learning path is currently under development. The following topics will be covered:

1. **Environment Setup** - ML libraries, tools, and frameworks
2. **Data Collection** - Gathering and organizing training data
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering
4. **Model Selection** - Choosing the right algorithm and architecture
5. **Training Implementation** - Building the training pipeline
6. **Model Evaluation** - Metrics, validation, and testing
7. **Optimization** - Hyperparameter tuning and model improvement
8. **Deployment** - Production deployment and monitoring

*This learning path is being developed. Check back soon for the complete guide!*
